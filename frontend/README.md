# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Public deployment (important)

In development, this app uses CRA's `proxy` (see `frontend/package.json`) so requests like `/api/auth/login` are forwarded to `http://localhost:5000`.

In production (public website), **there is no dev proxy**, so you must set the backend URL:

- Set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` to your backend origin (example: `https://your-backend.example.com`).
- Rebuild the frontend.

Example (PowerShell):

- `$env:REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL = "https://your-backend.example.com"`
- `npm run build`

## Open from a Mac / other device (LAN dev)

If you run the app on Windows and try to open it from a Mac, **do not use `localhost` on the Mac**.
`localhost` always means "this same machine", so the Mac will try to call its own `localhost:5000`.

On Windows:

- Start both servers on all interfaces: `npm run dev:lan`
- Find your Windows IP address (example: `192.168.1.10`)

On the Mac:

- Open: `http://<windows-ip>:3000`

If you are using `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`, set it to the Windows IP (example: `http://192.168.1.10:5000`) before building/running the frontend.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
